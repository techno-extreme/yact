          <h3>STIGMATIZATION</h3>
          <p>Stigma associated with HIV and AIDS related orphaned children.“Some people when they hear that someone’s
            HIV positive – especially us Africans – they’ll be seeing someone who’s dying, someone who is not supposed
            to touch anyone.” Stigma leads to people not being treated with dignity and respect.</p>

          <h3>CHILD HEADED FAMILIES</h3>
          <p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic has led to many situations where both parents have died and left behind
            a family of orphans.The children may begin taking over their parent's responsibilities before the last
            surviving
            parent has died, when the parent is sick or too weak to work. The eldest children often have to stop
            going to school and get a job instead in order to gain income for the family</p>

            there is a high prevalence of HIV and AIDS.. This has culminated into a high HIV related deaths leading to

        </h4>
        <p>
          Yamurai Aids Care Trust (YACT) is a community based trust that was founded in early 2018
          by individuals amongst which where pcs working in Dzivarasekwa. The PC’s during their work
          in Dzivarasekwa Extension noted with deep concern the plight of those infected and affected
          by HIV/AIDs in particular orphans. In coming together the group further noted that the situation
          in Dzivarasekwa was however not peculiar to DZ alone but rather a phenomenon in Zimbabwe.The
          desire to assist those in need led to the formation of Yamurai Aids Care Trust.
